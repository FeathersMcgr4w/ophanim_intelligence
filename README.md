# Ophanim Intelligence Project

## Threat intelligence, cyber intelligence, and cyber defense tool

The following project is a web-based tool that offers investigators a 24/7 proactive information service about domains, URLs, and IP addresses related to malicious, illegal, fraudulent, and unethical activities. It also aims to expose domains from relevant industry sectors such as government, finance, healthcare, education, energy, transportation, and telecommunications. For each domain, WHOIS, GEOIP, DNS, URLs, SSL certificate, HTTP headers, server status, category, and industry classification information will be exposed.

Ophanim Intelligence is based on the concept of the angel "Ophanim," a powerful entity with wheels full of eyes and living, all-seeing spirits. The tool proposes the innovative approach of segmenting the internet to identify the different resources hosted in the cyber world by category.
